Thread= It is light weight process performing single task

Multithreading: Multiple tasks(threads) are executing simultaneously are called  Multithreading.

//Steps to create the thread  by extending Thread

1. Create any user defined class and that extends Thread

   class  A extends Thread
   {

   }

2. override the run() of Thread class inside the  user defined class

  class  A extends Thread
   {
        public void run()
        {
          //task of Thread    
        }
   }

3. Create the object of user defined class and call the start() 
   A a1=new A();
    a1.start();


//steps for creating thread by implementing Runnable  interface

1. Create any user defined class and that implements Runnable interface


  class A implements Runnable
   {

   }

2.  override the run() of Runnable interface inside the  user defined class

 class A implements Runnable
   {
        public void run()
       {
          //task of thread
       }
   }


3. Create the Object of User Defined class.

   A a1=new A();

4. Create the Object of Thread of class with parameter of class A object

     Thread t1=new Thread(a1);

5. class the start() of Thread class
   
     t1.start();



//Thread class


//It is used to create thread

1. Thread()
2.Thread(String name)
3.Thread(Runnable r)
4.Thread(Runnable r,String name)
