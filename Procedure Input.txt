//procedure having 3 type of parameter

IN =     used to take the input from calling procedure when called procedure  is invoked
OUT=  used to give the the updated value from called procedure  to calling procedure after procedure execution

IN OUT=   take input from calling procedure into called procedure 
                                               AND
                  give the the updated value from called procedure  to calling procedure

when input parameter in procedure are NOT defined with IN,OUT or IN OUT,
by default they are considered as IN
